  <img src="mixmix_01.png" width="100% ">
  <p>Losing the essence of music, we started to create content that is faithful to music rather than stimulating content against the movement of large-scale and commercialization.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">We form a music culture that allows us to share with more people in a new way out of limited places and time constraints.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">We strongly believe that we are the curators of this culture; we highlight the artists who have shown their most recent activities and the artists who have shaped and led this culture in the past.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">As of 2021, we have over 500 contents. We provide the range in real-time through YouTube live streaming, and after broadcasting, it is exposed to users of the above platform and continuously flows into the content.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">"We value the experience that can be felt together through the textures, elements, and sounds of various dance music, centering on electronic music."</p>
